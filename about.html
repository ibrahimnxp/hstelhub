<h1>ABOUT US</h1>

    <p>About Us</p>
    Welcome to <k>HOSTELHUB FUNAAB</k>, a platform created to connect students of the Federal University of Agriculture, 
    Abeokuta (FUNAAB) with hostel owners offering accommodation. Our goal is to simplify the search for housing, helping 
    students find suitable and reliable hostels near campus.
    
    We provide a space where hostel owners can list their properties, making it easier for students to browse available options 
    and contact owners directly.
    
    <p>IMPORTANT NOTICE</p>
    
    
    Please be aware that <k>HOSTELHUB FUNAAB</k> does not own or manage any of the hostels listed on this platform. We are not involved in 
    any financial transactions or agreements made between students and hostel owners.
    
    <p>AVOID SCAMS</p>  
    - Always verify the hostel and its ownership before making any payments.  
    - Ensure you have personally inspected the property or consulted a trusted individual before committing financially.  
    
    We strive to offer a safe and efficient platform, but itâ€™s important for users to remain cautious and diligent when 
    securing accommodation.
    
    Thank you for trusting us to assist in your search for a hostel!
